# Darkside / SwapiBox 

Darkside is one week project for Front End Engineering students at the Turing School of Software & Design. Students were tasked with consuming the Star Wars API (SWAPI) to display information about characters, vehicles, planets, and the films. 

This website was build using the create-react-app starter kit. Dependencies include Jest/Enzyme for teting, and propTypes to check component types. We also utilized JavaScript ES6+ when creating all components.
